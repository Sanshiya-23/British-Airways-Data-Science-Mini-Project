# British-Airways-Data-Science-Mini-Project

The motive behind this presentation and the accompanying Jupyter notebook file is to provide a comprehensive analysis and actionable insights into customer behavior, specifically tailored for British Airways. Through the use of advanced data science techniques, including data preprocessing, model training, and feature importance analysis, we aimed to predict customer buying behavior with a high degree of accuracy. The project utilizes a RandomForest model, which successfully achieved an 85% accuracy rate. By leveraging interactive visualizations created with Plotly, the findings are made accessible and engaging, facilitating better decision-making. This work, undertaken as part of the Forage work experience program, not only showcases the practical application of machine learning but also underscores the importance of data-driven strategies in enhancing customer service and operational efficiency at British Airway
